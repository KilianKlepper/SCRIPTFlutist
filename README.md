## Overview

Welcome to the Stained Flutist, where we're turning an old colored glass window into a dazzling wall art piece that lights up like a conzert! This project is more than just LEDs and nostalgia; it's an RGB-tastic journey into the sentimental side of life. The window, once a part of a house filled with laughter and memories, is now getting its moment in the spotlight.

## Features

- Sentimental Illumination: We're not just throwing lights on a window; we're telling a storyâ€”nostalgia with a side of technicolor.

- RGB Glow: Bring the right emotion into the unique old frame. Play with different light settings and effect.

- Control: Use the haptic control pannel or impress your friends while controlling the window via the smartphone

- App Magic: challanging for us but easy to use. Turn the Flutist on and off or controll differen color settings

- Frame: Holding all in place with the sophisticated frame extension. Converting the LED spots into gradient lighting via frosted glass and a white backcover to get the most out of the light.

## Troubleshooting

The first test run on 26.11.23 was bombastic. However, we gained the following findings:

- The distance from the LEDs to the frosted glass is too small (2cm) this must be increased (3.5cm)

- therefore a frame must also be integrated

- an RGB effect of continuous full-surface colors is the best effect

- Light performance should be sufficient but 2-3 more meeters would be nice

- The screws must become longer

- The frame color was changed to white
